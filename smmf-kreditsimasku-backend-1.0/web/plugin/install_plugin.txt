The applet must be signed, to be allowed to access to files on the client side. The best way is to sign the applet 
with a real way.
  Here is an explanation on how to sign the with a 'test' certificate. You _must_ do that after each modification of 
the jar package.
    - Generate Private/Public key set.
       keytool -genkey -alias "jupload" -validity 3600 -dname "CN=JUpload, OU=Testing/Demo, O=JUpload.SourceForge.net, L=SourceForge, S=SourceForge, C=SG"
    - List key set.
       keytool -list
    - Sign the Applet with the private key.
       jarsigner wjhk.jupload.jar jupload
    - Verify the jar file have being sign properly.
       jarsigner -verify wjhk.jupload.jar

Another, interesting, way to sign the applet is provided by Martin Westin in this thread:

keytool -genkey -alias "scanner" -validity 3600 -dname "CN=Scanner, OU=Testing/Demo, O=Scanner, L=SourceForge, S=SourceForge, C=SG"
keytool -list
jarsigner scanner.jar scanner
jarsigner -verify scanner.jar
